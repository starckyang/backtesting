## MA Crossings:<br>
    There's an old technical analysis technique about MA lines. <br>
    The concept is to buy in a stock if the short-term MA line crosses the long term MA line, and sell it reversly.<br>
    The idea is short-term line indicates the market conscence towards the stock recently,<br>
    and long-term line represents the relatively "normal" thoughts on the stock.<br>
