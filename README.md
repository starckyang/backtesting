    MA Crossings:
        There's an old technical analysis technique about MA lines. The concept is to buy in a stock if the short-term MA line crosses the long term MA line, and sell it reversly.
        The idea is short-term line indicates the market conscence towards the stock recently, and long-term line represents the relatively "normal" thoughts on the stock.
