# Purpose
This is a repository for me to store my backtesting trials.

# Tools
## Grabber
    This object is built to retrieve stock data from TWSE (Taiwan Stock Exchange), currently, it can only be used <br>
    to get information inside the market of Taiwan

# Current Trials
## MA Crossings:<br>
    There's an old technical analysis technique about MA lines. <br>
    The concept is to buy in a stock if the short-term MA line crosses the long term MA line, and sell it reversly.<br>
    The idea is short-term line indicates the market conscence towards the stock recently,<br>
    and long-term line represents the relatively "normal" thoughts on the stock.<br>
### Result: MA Crossings is a trash indicator, it's even worse than doing nothing<br>
## MACD:<br>
    This indicator gives recent data more weight than the old ones, so we can more closely track the price trends.<br>
### Result: It's a pretty good indicator for index ETFs, as for other stocks, no further investigation is made (will be covered later on)
